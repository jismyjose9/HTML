                <h2>Communication skills are proof about what we’re as a human. It’s about how you behave and talk with people. It’s about how you’re influencing people around you.

                    For example, a professional communicator or a good person knows about the ways to communicate with different kinds of people in certain situations. They know how to talk with kids, parents, wife and family members, friends and strangers. In all these cases, it’s about respect.
                    
                     When you communicate humbly with all the people, it showcases how great you’re as a person. In which you don’t just communicate humbly for the sake of profits instead you do it because it’s your nature and character.
                    
                    There are many people who communicate with each person differently, for example, they communicate humbly and respectfully with the rich but badly with the poor. It’s their character and nature. They only communicate humbly and respectfully with the people that matched to their standard. And behind that there are reasons.
                    
                    So respectful and humble communication is a communication skill and that showcase the good/bad parts of the human character. And without good character, it’s tough to make an impact in the world and live a happy life. 
                    So respectful and humble communication is a communication skill and that showcase the good/bad parts of the human character. And without good character, it’s tough to make an impact in the world and live a happy life. A tongue can make thousands of friends and enemies at the same time. It’s about how and when you use it. For example in anger, we forget about the words and vocabulary. We don’t care about such a situation for rude behavior with other people. We don’t care about father, mother, real friend, wife, kid, customer or anyone in anger. And in anger, we use the words that hurt people from inside.

                    That’s why anger, aggressive and rude communication is a bad communication skill that can make more enemies than a friend or can convert an honest friend into an enemy. That’s why it’s important to remain calm in negative situations.
                    
                    For example, you’re reading, writing, working and driving or anything you’re doing. Someone distracted you in a big way unintentionally such as by playing music loudly, traffic jams, the line on the ticket counter, high sugar in tea, etc.
                    
                    Now the bad communicator becomes angrily and vomited the words in frustration. And at the same time, the other person got angry too. Not matter they know each other or not. But they will start fighting and debating and blaming each other for the cause. Within a few minutes, the debate can turn into a bigger fight.
                    
                    Now, what the cause of this fight?The cause is a lack of patience. Patience in communication is the most important skill and it is not in the half of the humans living on this planet. It looks like animals have dressed branded shoes and clothes and they are driving cars and working in the office. I know it’s tough to be calm all the time. But this is a test for a good communicator and a good person. If someone passed in this test, he/she will become a good communicator.

                    Patience in communication teaches you how to talk and when. If someone is angry, it’s important that you just listen. You don’t have to respond quickly. Just analyze the situation and time.
                    
                    Listening is the most important communication skill. It is silence. Silence has own words. That’s why I am also trying to be a good listener. It’s about receiving the input and filtering through knowledge and facts. Don’t’ talk if someone is not asking for an answer. But if they ask rudely/ badly it means they need love and trust.
                    
                    In this situation, you have to communicate softly and humbly. In this way, you will earn their and others’ respect. It will showcase the quality of your character. It will strengthen your friendship and partnership.
                    
                    That’s why I think good communication skills that are based on patience, observation, and analysis of the situation is important to live a happy and prosperous life.
